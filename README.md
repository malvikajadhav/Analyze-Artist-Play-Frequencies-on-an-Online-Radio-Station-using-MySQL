# Analyze-Artist-Play-Frequencies-on-an-Online-Radio-Station-using-MySQL
Listeners have complained about certain artists being overplayed on Radio Calico. The aim of the project is to check if this is true and identify underplayed artists. A CSV file of the previous month's play logs should be loaded to MySQL to find top/bottom 20 artists based on avg. daily.
